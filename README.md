# FSLAndPCLDataScraper

Hi! This is a scraper built with jsonlite and baseballr packages to collect data from Baseball Savant's JSON files of PCL and FSL (except for Daytona home) games. 

Please read the comments in the source code, as it should help you understand what you need to alter within the code to build a complete database of FSL and PCL games. For example, lines with file paths that you need to create: 48, 94, 105, 114, 118, 126

If you have any questions, reach out to me on Twitter @whoeferbaseball.

Enjoy!

-Will
